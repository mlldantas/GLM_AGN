# Unsupervised learning for AGN selection

  WHAN Classification Schema (Cid Fernandes et al., 2005)
  
   - (i) pure star-forming galaxies: log[N II]/Hα<−0.4 and WHα > 3Å; 
   - (ii) strong AGN (i.e. Seyferts): log[N II]/Hα>−0.4 and WHα > 6Å; 
   - (iii) weak AGN: log[N II]/Hα>−0.4 and WHα between 3 and 6Å; 
   - (iv) RGs (i.e. fake AGN):WHα < 3Å;
   - (v) passive galaxies (actually, lineless galaxies):WHα and W[N II] < 0.5Å.
